# End-to-end automation

To automate and run simulations end-to-end, MiV-Simulator includes a more high-level interface using [machinable](https://machinable.org). 

For documentation on how to install and use machinable, please refer to the [machinable project website](https://machinable.org).

Here, we provide an example script that constructs and runs the microcircuit simulation described in the previous sections.

In the `MiV-Simulator-Cases` repository, change into the `3-machinable` directory and run `microcircuit.py`.
